# Content Management System (CMS) Planning Document

## Use Cases:

1. **Content Creation**: Allow users to create various types of content such as articles, blog posts, pages, and multimedia.
2. **Content Editing**: Provide a user-friendly interface for editing content with options for rich text formatting, image uploads, and multimedia embedding.
3. **Content Publishing**: Enable users to publish content to make it publicly accessible on the website.
4. **Content Versioning**: Implement version control to track changes to content over time and allow users to revert to previous versions.
5. **User Management**: Allow administrators to manage user accounts, roles, and permissions.
6. **Search and Filtering**: Provide search functionality to help users find content based on keywords, categories, tags, etc.
7. **Analytics and Reporting**: Integrate with analytics tools to track content performance, user engagement, and other metrics.
8. **Security and Compliance**: Ensure data security and compliance with relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) regarding user data handling and privacy.

## GCP Services:

1. **Cloud SQL (PostgreSQL)**: For storing structured content data with strong ACID compliance and support for complex queries.
2. **Cloud Storage**: For storing multimedia files such as images, videos, and documents.
3. **Firebase Authentication**: For user authentication and authorization.
4. **Cloud Functions**: For serverless backend logic such as data validation, processing, and triggering events.
5. **Cloud CDN (Content Delivery Network)**: For delivering content quickly to users worldwide and optimizing website performance.
6. **Cloud Logging and Monitoring**: For tracking system performance, debugging, and generating reports.

## Backend Planning:

1. **Authentication**:
   - Use Firebase Authentication for user sign-up, sign-in, and token-based authentication.
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to enforce authorization rules for accessing CMS features and content.
2. **API Design**:
   - Design RESTful APIs for CRUD operations on content, user management, and other CMS functionalities.
   - Ensure API security by validating authentication tokens and implementing rate limiting and request validation.
3. **Server Logic**:
   - Write backend logic using Node.js with Express.js or Nest.js frameworks.
   - Implement business logic for content management, versioning, search, and user management.
   
## Frontend Planning:

1. **User Interface**:
   - Design a modern and intuitive user interface using frontend frameworks like React, Vue.js, or Angular.
   - Implement responsive design for seamless user experience across desktop and mobile devices.
2. **Content Editing**:
   - Integrate rich text editors like Draft.js or Quill.js for content creation and editing.
   - Provide media upload functionality for adding images, videos, and other multimedia content.
3. **Authentication Flow**:
   - Implement user authentication flows using Firebase Authentication SDK.
   - Design UI components for user registration, login, password reset, and profile management.
   
## Deployment:

1. **Backend Deployment**:
   - Deploy backend services to Google Cloud Functions or Cloud Run for serverless execution.
   - Configure environment variables for connecting to Cloud SQL database, Firebase Authentication, and other services.
2. **Frontend Deployment**:
   - Build frontend assets using tools like Webpack or Create React App.
   - Deploy frontend application to Google Cloud Storage or use Firebase Hosting for static content hosting.
3. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**:
   - Set up CI/CD pipelines using Google Cloud Build or other CI/CD tools for automated testing and deployment.
   - Trigger deployments on code commits to maintain a streamlined development workflow.

## Monitoring:

1. **Logging and Error Handling**:
   - Utilize Cloud Logging to monitor application logs, track errors, and debug issues.
   - Implement error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle exceptions and failures.
2. **Performance Monitoring**:
   - Set up Cloud Monitoring to track performance metrics such as response time, latency, and throughput.
   - Monitor resource utilization of backend services and database instances for optimization.
3. **Alerting**:
   - Configure alerting policies to receive notifications for critical events, anomalies, or performance degradation.
   - Set up alerts for backend errors, latency spikes, and resource exhaustion to proactively address issues.
